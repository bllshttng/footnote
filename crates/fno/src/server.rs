//! The mux server: owns N PTY-backed panes organized as squads -> tabs ->
//! pane trees, streams pane-tagged self-contained frames to attached clients
//! over the session socket, and executes layout commands on one core loop.
//!
//! Concurrency shape (the epic's locked channel discipline):
//! - client -> server input/control rides bounded mpsc channels that are
//!   AWAITED - never dropped. Backpressure flows to the socket, then the
//!   client.
//! - server -> client has TWO outbound paths per client. `Layout`/`ModeSync`/
//!   `Notice`/`Bye` ride a bounded RELIABLE mpsc the writer task always
//!   drains first; render `Frame`s ride a droppable per-(client, pane)
//!   newest-wins dirty map + `Notify`. A flooded pane coalesces to its newest
//!   frame per client without starving siblings or the reliable stream.
//! - PTY masters are blocking, so reads live on dedicated threads (`pty.rs`)
//!   feeding ONE shared pane-tagged channel into the core loop; tokio stays
//!   at the edges. Layout mutations happen exclusively ON the core loop, so
//!   a split racing a child exit is serialized, never interleaved.
//!
//! The server is the single source of truth for every grid. It outlives every
//! client: attach/detach/kill -9 of a client never touches a PTY. The session
//! ends when the last pane of the last tab of the last squad closes (Locked
//! Decision 8) - THAT sends `Bye` and exits, superseding Phase 1's rendered
//! "exited" state.
